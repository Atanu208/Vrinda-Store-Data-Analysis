# Vrinda-Store-Data-Analysis
In this project, I have performed data cleaning, processing, analysis and dashboard creation of store data in Excel.

Insights from store data  
1.Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%).
2.Maharashtra, Karnataka and Utter Pradesh are the top 3.
3.Adult age group (30-49 years) is max contributing (~50%).
4.Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80%).

Final Conclusion to improve Vrinda Store Sales:
Target women customers of age group (30-49 years) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Utter Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels.
